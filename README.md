Description
-
Based on the iPinYou dataset, we worked on a real-time bidding strategy formation problem. The goal was to help advertisers to formulate the optimal bidding strategy in order to get the best results in a real-time bidding system. By comparing different bidding strategies, such as constant and random bidding, linear and non-linear bidding, and multiagent bidding strategies, we selected the best strategy to compete with different teams and obtain clicks as many as possible.
